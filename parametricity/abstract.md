# Parametricity, Functional Programming, Types

In this talk, we define the principle of functional programming, then go into
detail about what becomes possible by following this principle. In particular,
parametricity (Wadler, 1989) and exploiting types in API design are an essential
property of productive software teams, especially teams composed of volunteers
as in open-source. This will be demonstrated.

Some of our most important programming tools are neglected, often argued away
under a false compromise. Why then, are functional programming and associated
consequences such as parametricity so casually disregarded? Are they truly so
unimportant? In this talk, these questions are answered thoroughly and without
compromise.

We will define the principle of functional programming, then go into
detail about common problems to all of software development. We will build the
case from ground up and finish with detailed practical demonstration of a
solution to these problems. The audience should expect to walk away with a
principled understanding and vocabulary of why functional programming and
associated techniques have become necessary to software development.
