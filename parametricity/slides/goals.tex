\begin{quotation}
The Marine Corps' F-35B aircraft are being delivered with Block 2B software, which Gilmore said has ``hundreds of unresolved deficiencies.'' And those problems have compounded in Block 3F software. That's because the first round of Block 3 was created by ``re-hosting the immature Block 2B softwareâ€¦into new processors to create Block 3i,'' the initial release for the code, Gilmore noted. This led to ``avionics instabilities and other new problems, resulting in poor performance during developmental testing.''
